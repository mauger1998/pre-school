                        <p>Doogle loves going for walks with the children and is a good listener. He loves hearing all the wonderful stories the children chat to him about. He will hopefully become our therapy dog in due course. He is very soft and gentle and loves cuddles. Due to the nature of his breed he has a hypoallergenic fur and doesn’t shed which is good for children who are allergic or sensitive to this. He has a wonderful nature and is loved by everyone at preschool!</p>
